Once the item is expired
{
	remove the item from the list of items in home page
	change the status of the Item to be Expired on top of Item Page
	Remove the bidding box
	Show the winner
	subtract money from the users account
	return money back to all the users that bid on that item (How to do that??????)
		IDEA: when some bids higher than the previous bidder return back the previous higgest bid to the user
}
